Infrastructure & Network Engineering  
Security+ | Network+ (In Progress)

I design and document segmented infrastructure environments focused on
security, least-privilege access control, and operational resilience.


## Core Focus Areas
- VLAN segmentation and network isolation
- Least-privilege firewall policy design
- Dockerized service architecture
- Secure remote access (VPN)
- Backup and recovery planning
- Linux system administration
- Infrastructure documentation


## Featured Project

### infrastructure-lab
A production-style segmented infrastructure lab simulating enterprise
network architecture.

**Key elements**
- Multi-VLAN design (Management, Servers, IoT, Clients, Guest, VPN)
- Default-deny firewall posture with documented policy matrix
- Dockerized services with configuration templating
- Secure VPN access restricted to management plane
- Documented backup and recovery strategy
- Hardening checklist and operational reasoning

This lab demonstrates architectural thinking beyond simple service deployment.


## Certifications
- CompTIA A+
- CompTIA Security+
- Network+ (In Progress)


## Career Direction
Open to infrastructure, network, and systems engineering roles where secure design, automation, and operational stability matter.
